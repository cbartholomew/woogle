Why make a command line search function when Blizzard has added a search box already in the bags?

I do enjoy the Blizzard's UI Bag Search. I think it's a brilliant addition; however, I find making an additional three clicks (open bag, click into search area, click "X" to clear search area), typing out my query, and looking for my query (with a portrait that isn't always obvious) very inconvenient - especially, when you just want to get/use something on the fly.
 
Why don't you just organize your bags better?

Because I have ADD, I'm unorganized by design.      

Ok, Whatevs - How do you use it?

/woogle or /woo <item or partial item name> [optional usability switch] 

Wait, what?

Let me explain through Dialog-

Dialog One - Pickup Item Only (No Usability Switch):

PlayerA: "Dude, give me a health stone already - arena is about to start! lol"
PlayerB: "yea, yea, just a sec - let me woogle it."
PlayerB: /woo health 
            
What happens here is the following:
1. All bag(s) close, except the bag(s) that contains the healthstone
2. Healthstone item will be locked to the player's cursor automatically, so he can drag it over to PlayerA for a trade. 

Cool, but how do multiple items with the same name react?

Right now, if there is more than one - for example: woogling for "glad" when you have Gladiator Pieces will just open all the bags, which contain this matching criteria. 

Give a shot! Thanks for woogling!
